BattleChess


Description
----------
BattleChess is a pilot project to create a Java turn-based chess game.


Installation Instructions
----------
1: In upper left corner of "CSCE3513/Team1" directory, click "ZIP" button to download directory as .zip file.
2: Once .zip file is downloaded, extract entire project folder anywhere.
3: Browse folder to "BattleChess\build\" directory.
4: Double click on "BattleChess.html" to open game in default web browser.

Game Instructions
----------
Standard chess game with alternating turns between the players: white first, then black.


Controls
----------
Click on a piece once to select it. Then click on the square you would like to move to or take a piece from. Clicking on the "New Game" button at any time will start a new game.


Known bugs
----------
Checkmate can happen, but there is no function that calculates checkmate or message that says that you have actually put a player into 'checkmate' due to time restrictions and the complicated algorithms to do so.
If it is the first move for a pawn, the pawn will jump over a piece that is one-square direclty in front of that pawn. IE: white pawn is directly in front of un-moved black pawn. Black pawn's first move can jump over white pawn.

System Requirements
----------
Java
